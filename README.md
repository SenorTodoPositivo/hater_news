 
Hater News
==========

Haterz Gonna Hate. But now you know who the haterz are.

The Idea.
---------
Using [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)'s [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) and [Logistic Regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) you can start to build out a way to analyize all the comments a user ever has posted in Hacker News and rank how big of a troll they are.


How It's Built.
---------

Feel free to download either [the HTML](https://github.com/kevinmcalear/hater_news/blob/master/haterz_classification.html) or [iPython Notebook](https://github.com/kevinmcalear/hater_news/blob/master/haterz_classification.ipynb) files from this repo. I tried to detail out my explorations and assumtions about the model so you can follow my logic and learn why and how I built everything.

***Side Note:*** I'm going to make it a [Chrome App](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) soon. I'm also going to build versions of this for Twitter, reddit, Instagram, Facebook, and maybe even dating apps. If you want to help, reach out! :)


Getting Started.
---------

####Prepare the app

Execute the following commands to clone this repo:

	$ git clone git@github.com:kevinmcalear/hater_news.git
	$ cd hater_news

You now have a functioning git repository that contains the app as well as a [requirements.txt](https://github.com/kevinmcalear/hater_news/blob/master/requirements.txt) and a [Procfile](https://github.com/kevinmcalear/hater_news/blob/master/Procfile), which are required to run our app in Heroku or using foreman.

####Running the app locally

You can run the app locally one of two ways:

By using foreman:

	$ foreman start

Or by running the app.py file with python:
	
	$ python app.py
	
[foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) gives you a decent preview of how the app will run when on Heroku. I have printed out several things to the console for debugging and exploration which will show up if you run the app with the `python app.py` command.

####Hosting with Heroku

[Sign Up for Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/signup)

[Install Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/osx)

Once installed, you can use the heroku command from your command shell.

**Log in using the email address and password you used when creating your Heroku account:**

	$ heroku login
	Enter your Heroku credentials.
	Email: python@example.com
	Password:
	Could not find an existing public key.
	Would you like to generate one? [Yn]
	Generating new SSH public key.
	Uploading ssh public key /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	
Press enter at the prompt to upload your existing ssh key or create a new one, used for pushing code later on.

To check that your key was added, type heroku keys. If your key isnâ€™t there, you can add it manually by typing heroku keys:add. For more information about SSH keys, see [Managing Your SSH Keys](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys).


####Deploy the app to Heroku

Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code. * **Note:** we need to use [this buildpack](https://github.com/thenovices/heroku-buildpack-scipy) to get everything to work for sklearn and scipy.

For a new app:

	heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/thenovices/heroku-buildpack-scipy

For an existing app:

	heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/thenovices/heroku-buildpack-scipy

This also creates a remote repository (called heroku) which it configures in your local git repo. Heroku generates a random name for your app.  * **Note:**  you can pass a parameter to specify your own name, or rename it later with `heroku apps:rename`.

Now deploy your code:

	$ git push heroku master
	git push heroku master
	Fetching repository, done.
	Counting objects: 7, done.
	Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
	Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
	Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 457 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
	Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)

	       https://haternews.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku

	To git@heroku.com:haternews.git
	   f335692..bfb7017  master -> master

The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:

	$ heroku ps:scale web=1

Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:

	$ heroku open
