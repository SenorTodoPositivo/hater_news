      "### Normalized Term Frequency Weights\n",
      "\n",
      "Encoding the terms' raw frequencies in the feature vector provides additional information about the meanings of the documents, but assumes that all of the documents are of similar lengths. Many words might appear with the same frequency in two documents, but the documents could still be dissimilar if one document is many times larger than the other.  \n",
      "\n",
      "scikit-learn's `TfdfTransformer` can mitigate this problem by transforming a matrix of term frequency weights into a matrix of normalized term frequency weights. By default, `TfdfTransformer` smooths the raw counts and applies L2 normalization. The smoothed, normalized term frequencies are given by the equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "$tf(t, f) = \\frac{f(t, d)}{||x||}$\n",
      "\n",
      "### Inverse Document Weights\n",
      "\n",
      "While normalized term frequencies mitigate the effects of different document lengths, another problem remains. Our feature vectors contain large weights for terms that occur frequently in a document, even if those terms occur frequently in most documents in the corpus. These terms do not help to represent the meaning of a particular document relative to the rest of the corpus. For example, most of the documents in a corpus of articles about Duke's basketball team could include the words \u201cbasketball\u201d, \u201cCoach K\u201d, and \u201cflop\u201d. These words can be thought of as corpus-specific stop words, and may not be useful for calculating the similarity of documents. The *inverse document frequency*, or IDF, is a measure of how rare or common a word is in a corpus. The inverse document frequency is given by the equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "$idf(t, d) = log \\frac{N}{1 + | d \\in D: t \\in d|}$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $N$ is the total number of documents in the corpus, and $| d \\in D: t \\in d|$ is the number of documents in the corpus that contain term . A term's tf-idf weight is the product of its term frequency and inverse document frequency. `TfidfTransformer` returns tf-idfs weight when its `use_idf` keyword argument is set to its default value, `True`. Since tf-idf weighted feature vectors are commonly used to represent text, scikit-learn provides a `TfidfVectorizer` class that wraps `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer`. Let's use `TfidfVectorizer` to create tf-idf weighted feature vectors for our corpus."
