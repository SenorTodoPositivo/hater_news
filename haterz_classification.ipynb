The plant and expertise required to build panels is clean room stuff that AAPL just does not do. It does industrial design and software. Not &quot;manufacturing of screens&quot; so the point is clear. Android&#x27;s skin is distant enough from Java and Linux that it can credibly be called a creation of Google. Just as Audi can say it built the car without having to credit the inventor of the internal combustion engine, and instructing a supplier to build a part to its specifications is hardly &quot;manufacturing&quot; it. It is &quot;specifying&quot; it. As every Apple product owner knows: &quot;Designed in California, MADE in China&quot;. In this case, made in Japan&#x2F;korea. As such, &quot;we manufacture&quot; is skirting close to the edge of a lie if &quot;we&quot; is spoken at an Apple branded press conference with no mention whatsoever of partners.',\n",
